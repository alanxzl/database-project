# database-project
Everyone can create their own workspaces and invite people to join it. In each workspace, they can create different channels such as private ones and public ones. And in every channel, as long as you are a member of this channel, you can see the history of the discussion and can send messages in the channel so that every one in it can see your messages. When people receive the invitation, they can decline or accept it.  This project is built with Python and Flask.
